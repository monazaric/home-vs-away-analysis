Project Overview

This project analyzes how player/team performance varies between home and away games. By computing key statistics, visualizing trends, and evaluating statistical significance, we aim to understand the impact of game location on performance.

Features

Statistical Analysis: Compare key performance metrics such as Points Per Game (PPG), Field Goal Percentage (FG%), Turnovers (TOs), and more.

Data Visualization: Generate graphs and charts to highlight trends and differences.

1. Data Collection

Obtain game performance data from publicly available datasets, APIs, or manually recorded stats.

Include relevant features such as date, location, player/team statistics, and game outcomes.


2. Statistical Analysis

Calculate averages and standard deviations for key metrics (PPG, FG%, TOs, etc.).

Compute the differences in performance between home and away games.

3. Data Visualization

Create bar charts to compare team and player statistics at home vs. away.

Use box plots to illustrate distributions and variability.

Implement scatter plots to explore correlations between variables.

4. Interpretation & Conclusions

Identify patterns and trends that suggest home-court advantages or disadvantages.

Discuss potential external factors (e.g., travel fatigue, crowd influence, refereeing bias).

Suggest areas for further research or dataset expansion.
