Project Overview

This project analyzes how player/team performance varies between home and away games. By computing key statistics, visualizing trends, and evaluating statistical significance, we aim to understand the impact of game location on performance.

Features

Statistical Analysis: Compare key performance metrics such as Points Per Game (PPG), Field Goal Percentage (FG%), Turnovers (TOs), and more.

1. Data Collection

Obtain game performance data from publicly available datasets, APIs, or manually recorded stats.

Include relevant features such as date, location, player/team statistics, and game outcomes.


2. Statistical Analysis

Calculate averages and standard deviations for key metrics (PPG, FG%, TOs, etc.).

Compute the differences in performance between home and away games.

User can choose and input games they are interested in analyzing.


3. Interpretation & Conclusions

Identify patterns and trends that suggest home-court advantages or disadvantages.
